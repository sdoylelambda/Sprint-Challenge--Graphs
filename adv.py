# MY CODE START
# You may find the commands player.current_room.id, player.current_room.get_exits() and player.travel(direction) useful.
#
# To solve this path, you'll want to construct your own traversal graph.

# You start in room 0, which contains exits ['n', 's', 'w', 'e'].

# Your starting graph should look something like this:
# {
#   0: {'n': '?', 's': '?', 'w': '?', 'e': '?'}
# }
#
# Try moving south and you will find yourself in room 5 which contains exits ['n', 's', 'e'].
# You can now fill in some entries in your graph:
# {
#   0: {'n': '?', 's': 5, 'w': '?', 'e': '?'},
#   5: {'n': 0, 's': '?', 'e': '?'}
# }
#
# You know you are done when you have exactly 500 entries (0-499) in your graph and no '?' in the adjacency dictionaries
# To do this, you will need to write a traversal algorithm that logs the path into traversal_path as it walks.
#
# HINTS
#  There are a few smaller graphs in the file to test traversal method on before committing to the large graph.

# Start by writing an algorithm that picks a random unexplored direction from the player's current room, travels and
# logs that direction, then loops.

# This should cause your player to walk a depth-first traversal.

# At dead-end (i.e. a room with no unexplored paths), walk back to the nearest room that does contain an unexplored path

# You can find the path to the shortest unexplored room by using a breadth-first search
# for a room with a '?' for an exit. If you use the bfs code from the homework <***


# Instead of searching for a target vertex, you are searching for an exit with a '?' as the value.
# If an exit has been explored, you can put it in your BFS queue like normal.

# BFS will return the path as a list of room IDs.
# You will need to convert this to a list of n/s/e/w directions before you can add it to your traversal path.
